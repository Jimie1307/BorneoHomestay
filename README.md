# BorneoHomestay
<br> A project done during two courses (smae lecturer for both courses). 
<br> The first part was just a simple CSS implementation (I think?), and then the later course includes building a functional website using PHP and HTML/CSS.

## Background Story
<br> In the beginning, it was an individual project. Then, it turned into a group project. For the group project, a few additional functions were needed to add alongside other optional stuff. 
<br> <br> Supposedly, we had to do it asa group but a lot of them were inactive. The compiler of my group (one of the inactive members) decided to compile our submitted parts last minute (the night before presentation), and decided to code it all by himself in one night, but failed.
<br> <br> I did not know this until around 12am by my own friend through private chat. She showed me his current progress and it was...disappointing. None of the pages linked with each other. It was a mess. She then suggested to just use my Borneo Homestay website since she knows I already completed it. 
<br> <br> Hence, this is all the files included to build the homestay web application by scratch using PHP mainly. 

<br><br>Sadly, the online link to view it has expired.
